# Video Summarization with Audio Output

This `README.md` provides step-by-step instructions for setting up and running the video summarization project. All the commands are included with detailed explanations.

```bash
# Step 1: Clone the Repository
# Clone the project repository to your local machine.
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/video-summarization.git
cd video-summarization

# Step 2: Install Required Libraries
# Ensure Python 3.8+ is installed. Install the required dependencies using pip.
pip install torch torchvision transformers gtts streamlit opencv-python-headless

# Step 3: Dataset Preparation
# Download the MSR-VTT Dataset from the official website:
# https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/msr-vtt-video-to-text-description-dataset/
# After downloading, organize the dataset as follows:
# 
# /path-to-dataset/
# ├── TrainValVideo/          # Folder containing video files
# ├── captions.txt            # File containing video captions
#
# Update the paths in the `config.py` file to point to your dataset's location.

# Step 4: Preprocess the Dataset
# Run the preprocessing script to prepare the dataset for training.
python preprocess.py

# Step 5: Extract Features
# Use the extract_features.py script to process video frames and extract features
# using a pretrained model like VGG16.
python extract_features.py

# Step 6: Train the Model
# Run the training script to train the encoder-decoder model.
python fork-of-train.py

# Optional Step: Run on Kaggle
# If you prefer running the project on Kaggle, access the following notebooks:
# 
# Train Notebook: https://www.kaggle.com/code/bhaveshsandbhor/fork-of-train
# Preprocessing Notebook: https://www.kaggle.com/code/bhaveshsandbhor/preprocess
# Feature Extraction Script: https://www.kaggle.com/code/bhaveshsandbhor/extract-features
# Configuration File: https://www.kaggle.com/code/bhaveshsandbhor/config
# 
# Upload your dataset to Kaggle and execute the code through these notebooks.

# Step 7: Launch the Interface
# Start the Streamlit web app for video summarization.
streamlit run app.py

# Using the Interface
# 1. Upload a video file through the interface.
# 2. The system will process the video and generate a summarized text caption.
# 3. The caption will be converted to audio, which you can play directly in the app.

# Setup Complete!
# You can now summarize videos and generate audio outputs using the system.
